    "# Analyzing Model Performance\n",
    "In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing error rates on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `max_depth` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects learning and testing errors. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone."

    "**Answer: **   Considering _training error_ for a max depth of 1, there is an initial rapid spike in error, after which the error settles down.  This occurs around $n=50$.  Following this, the error is fairly linear with a slow increase in the size of training error. For a max depth of 6, there is no initial spike in the training error and the error more rapidly settles into a nearly linear increase. Looking at a max depth of 10, we can see that the error curve of the training data improves significantly as we increase the depth of our decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a large depth, the error is very small for a small $n$ signifying that the data is essentially being memorized. As the training set grows larger, it becomes impossible to fit all of the data and the error increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering _testing error_ all depths begins with a large spike and settle down by n=50.  The large spike may be a function of the fact the it is unlikely that the model has previously seen similar data. As the training set grows larger, more points have been included and it becomes increasingly likely that the model has seen similar data. That said, at a certain point, about $n=50$, the model has essentially seen a broad enough range of \"types\" of points that adding more points to the training set does little to decrease the error. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is extremely important that while training data performance improves significantly increases with decision tree depth, test data performance does not."

The error for a depth of 10 would indicate overfitting or high variance in that the error for the training data is 0 for all $n#, but the error for the test data is nearly the same as that for a depth of greater than 6 and is very large compared to the training data.

    "**Answer: **   In analyzing our Model Complexity plot, we are essentially looking at the Bias-Variance Trade-Off .  While mean absolute error was used as a performance metric, consider the following.  For mean square error, the expected test MSE is given by [^jamesstat]  \n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\mathbb{E}\\left(y_0-\\hat{f}(x_0)\\right)^2=\\text{Var}(\\hat{f}(x_0))+\\left[\\text{Bias}(\\hat{f}(x_0))\\right]^2+\\text{Var}(\\epsilon)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  With the Variance and the Bias both positive numbers and Var$(\\epsilon)$, i.e. the error inherent to the data itself and thus independent of the model, we seek to simultaneously minimize the Variance and the Bias.  With lesser complexity, a lower max depth, we have an oversimplified model which corresponds to underfitting or increased bias.  With higher complexity, a higher max depth, we have overfitting or high variance.  The trade-off between the two corresponds to the U-shape of the plot of test error versus model complexity.  The minimum of this plot represent the point where a given complexity simultaneously minimizes variance and bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "  It would appear that the test data error has a minimum near a depth of 6, while training error continues to decrease asymptotically as depth increases.  Based upon this the error would decrease as depth increases until the depth of 6, after which it would increase, suffering from over fitting.  This would signify that with a model depth of less than six we have an underfit model and with a model depth of higher than six we have an overfit model."

    "**Answer: **  In analyzing the model complexity plot, we estimated that an optimal depth would be 6. The result here finds an optimal depth (over ten trials) of 5.8. Earlier, we calculated that the mean house price for a home in the dataset was $22.533, with a standard deviation of house price of 9.188. Both of the values returned by our model are reasonable and match the expectations of our earlier work. "

    "**Answer: **  As humans, we have little intuition for a 13-dimensional domain.  In order to make full use of the dataset we were given, we need to used an advanced regression model. For this work, we use a [decision tree](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) as our regressor.  Decision trees are used in both classification and regression analyses, and are perfectly suited to supervised learning.  The decision tree is used to train a model that can predict the value of a target variable.  It works well for our regression in which we are seeking to predict the target value of median value of an owner owner-occupied home.  The decision tree itself predicts which is the most relevant of the feature variables being passed to the model (at each decision node) and thus much of the work of the tree is largely out of our hands.  One parameter over which we do have some control is the depth of the tree regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major disadvantages of decision tree regression is a tendency to overfit, particularly with data sets with a large number of features.  Given our 13-feature set, we certainly run this risk.  The best way in which we can prevent overfitting is by setting a maximum depth for our decision tree.  To find an ideal maximum depth, we perform a series of regressions using varying decision tree depths.  We performed this analysis both manually and using a grid search, cross-validation.  As such the technique makes use of the large data set and does so in a wholly reasonable fashion. "
