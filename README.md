# Housing Model Development

This repository began as a Udacity Nanodegree project working on the Boston Housing Data. Final work for this early work in machine learning can be viewed [here](doc/boston_housing.pdf). 

Later, this was reworked with a deeper emphasis on linear models [here](ipynb/boston_redux.ipynb).
